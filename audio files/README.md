This folder contains all the audio files extracted from the device!

The .aac files are what is played on the Qubo, but the .mp3 files are the "hidden" ones :p


 * The .aac files can be found under directory /customer/audio and /usr/audio
 
 * The "hidden" .mp3 files can be found under /customer/res
